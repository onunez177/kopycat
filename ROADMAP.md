Roadmap
======

## Upcoming features and issues

* Research Python cryptographic libraries, and migrate kopycat to the one which
  appears to be the most secure.
* Add mocks to test HTTP requests
* Take advantage of custom metadata; multipart files, stego, support for HMAC,
  lots of possibilities.

## Under consideration

* Add kopy.io's SSL certificate into the repository, since its not valid for
  that domain?
* Specify the key in an environment variable for easier shell scripting?
