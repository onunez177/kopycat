Roadmap
======

## Upcoming features and issues

* More shell-script friendly failure conditions are the priority.
* Research Python cryptographic libraries, and migrate kopycat to the one which
  appears to be the most secure.
* Add a more intuitive way of specifying the period of time a documet should be
  up for, ie, if I want the document to stay up for one day, I shouldn't have
  to calculate the propper number of seconds; I should be able to say, 1d
* Add mocks to test HTTP requests

## Under consideration

* Add kopy.io's SSL certificate into the repository, since its not valid for
  that domain?
* Add support for steganography?
* Specify the key in an environment variable for easier shell scripting?
