kopycat - kopy.io library and CLI
=================================

kopy.io is a paste service with support for AES-256-CBC encryption.

The encryption happens client-side, in the browser, with Crypto-JS. This means
that kopy.io cannot see the content of your documents.

This library implements kopy.io's API.

The CLI is pretty much finished, just a few more bugs to work out. :)
